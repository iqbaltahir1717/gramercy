                    <p>Opening the Jakarta-Merak toll road exit in 2009 was the catalyst to the development of the commercial area at Alam Sutera, as it offered easier connectivity to BSD, Tangerang, Jakarta and other areas. The commercial area continued to grow due to this location and access, with visibility from the toll road also proving an attractive incentive for investors such as IKEA and Alfaland Group. </p>
